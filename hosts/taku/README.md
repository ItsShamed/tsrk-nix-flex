## Description

This is my first custom desktop PC, which replaces an old HP OMEN "gaming" PC,
which is now unusable because of Windows 11 :(.

I was already planning on using Linux on this host, so I was smart enough to
plan using Linux-friendly components so that I don't have to deal with a lot of
troubleshooting, especially with NixOS.

This is my main workload computer, my comfort zone, my home! I mostly planned
components to do full-stack developement, and game developement (osu! ;))
without having to endure the pain of JetBrains eating all of my RAM.
But I also play video-games from time to time and it handles that pretty well!

I also do music production, but unfortunately the music industry is not open
enough to be able to do that inside Linux, which means that I have a dual-booted
stripped Windows 11 installation to do just that.
