## Description

This is my second laptop. It's my school laptop that I bought in 2021 to be
able to maintain my workflow while travelling. It's with this laptop that I
convinced myself to daily drive Linux.

It used to a dual-boot of Windows 11 and Arch Linux. Unfortunately, the
partionning was hasardous and it suffered a lot of problems, including running
out of storage.

I've since bought new SSDs to do everything from zero (at this point it was
unrecoverable). It still has a Windows 11 partition in case work requires me to
use software that is proprietary and compatible only on Windows â€“ actually never
happened so far, since I mostly did DevOps work.

It's not as fast and powerful as [`taku`](../taku/README.md) but is still
useful to do things while roaming, especially during internships where I have
to do a lot of work while moving between places.
