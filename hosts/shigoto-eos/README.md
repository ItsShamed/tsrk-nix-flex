# shigoto EOS

*Status: work in progress 👷*

## Description

This is the laptop provided by the company I work at for my end-of-studies
internship.
It initially came with Windows but co-workers said that I could wipe it to
whathever I wanted so… we're here!

It seems like a pretty decent laptop for an office laptop.

### Why "仕事EOS" and not "アルバイトEOS" if it's an internship?

Because my co-workers would stare at me really weirdly if I were to call the
work computer provided by the company "arbeit"…
<sub>
    and given a certain context in the company I probably should avoid doing
    that lmao
</sub>

### Isn't [`ren`](../ren) supposed to be your host for roaming purposes?

Well… yeah… but… it's starting to show signs of it being really senile… you
know… like… 5 years is a lot for a laptop… right…?
And… I might be looking to be replacing it with a Framework anyway? Since the
NixOS foundation announced their
[partnership with Framework](https://nixos.org/blog/announcements/2026/framework-partnership-announcement/)
this might actually be a good deal for me. (even if memory prices are still too
high smh fuck ai)
