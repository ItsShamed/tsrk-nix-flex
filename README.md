# tsrk. Nix Flex

*(you get it? because it's pronounced likes "flakes". laugh now.)*

This is *will be* my all-in-one NixOS and Home-Manager configuration.

If you're from EPITA and specifically from the Forge, yes, I've been inspired
A LOT by the PIE (to not say this is a rip-off) minus a lot of admin stuff that
I will likely never use (yet?).
